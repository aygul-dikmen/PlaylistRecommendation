# PlaylistRecommendation
This project is about taking the userâ€™s Spotify playlist inding related songs by using Machine Learning similarity algorithms. 

Observing the needs of the user in sales and marketing and taking action according to these needs is the most important and most profitable area of marketing. From the past to the present, people who want to sell something use information about buyers. These needs can be estimated more accurately using available physical and behavioral data. The estimation of user needs is used in advertising today to increase profits. The main reason for using recommendation systems is to recommend the most suitable product to the user or to provide the best user experience.
In this project, Spotify API, and Spotipy open source code library was used to retrieve user data.
